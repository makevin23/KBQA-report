\section{Task Definition}

In the "Knowledge-based Question Answering" project group, 
we aim to develop a question answering system, 
which receives a natural language question from a user, 
then responses with the answer of this question based on the knowledge from DBpedia. 

In order to answer a question,
the first step is to convert the question to a SPARQL query,
with which the knowledge in DBpedia can be queried as a relational database. 
Once we get a response from the DBpedia endpoint, 
the answer is extracted and presented to the user. 

This QA System should also be evaluated on QALD 8 and 9 datasets with gerbil.
Gerbil provides scores and average answering time. 
We want our system to answer as many questions as possible with acceptable answer time.
