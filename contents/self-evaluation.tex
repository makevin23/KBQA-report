\section{Self-evaluation}

In this two semester I think my job was done well. 
I am glad to cooperate with my teammates and help with any issues. 
I have fixed many problems with my teammates together,
at the same time, I have learned numerous things from them. 
I have spent a lot of time every week in this project
and kept thinking about 
how to improve our approach
or where is the issue. 
I also came up with ideas for improving our approach, 
we tried them, the results are good and bad.
Sometimes we went to the wrong direction, for example with ConvS2S, 
but the ultimate result of our approach is excellent. 
Due to lack of practical experience with building neural network and training on server, 
our project sometime progressed slowly. 
Therefore, I would give myself a score of 1.7.
