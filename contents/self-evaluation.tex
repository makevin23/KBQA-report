\section{Self-evaluation}

In this two semester I think I did a good job. 
I am glad to cooperate and help other teammates. 
If others have some problem, 
I am willing to help and find the solution together. 
I also came up with some ideas for improving our approach, 
we tried several of them, the results are good and bad.
Sometimes we went to the wrong direction, for example with NSpM, 
but in the end the result of our approach is good. 
Due to lack of practical experience with buiding neural network and training on server, 
the speed of development was slowed down. 
Therefore, I would give myself a score of 1.7.
