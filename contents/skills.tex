\section{Learned Skills}

During this two semester project group,
I have learned a lot in all aspects. 

% Scrum
We used Scrum to manage our team,
therefore, I have gathered some experience with Scrum, 
e.g. How to be a Scrum master, 
how to manage weekly tasks with a board, 
and what to do in meetings. 
Also, the most important thing is how to work as a team, 
since a usually worked alone. 

% coding
I have also improved my coding style in this project. 
Thanks to the linter, 
I wrote more readable code and never forgot to add comments on each function, 
which make it easier for others and me later to understand.

% git
I have also formed good habits in git, 
committing frequently and with meaningful comments. 
I practiced git functions such as new branch, merge, rebase, 
and also how to handle merge conflicts. 
Additionally, I have learned how to set up CI/CD in Github from my teammates, 
which simplified our deployment.

% VM
This is my first time working with network on a virtual machine
with nginx, REST and docker. 
I think this experience can be applied on many other projects. 

% dbpeida
I got my first insight into knowledge graph in this project group
and knew how sparql query is written. 

% NLP
The last but not least,
I learned much about natural language processing in praxis, 
including encoder and decoder, tokenizer, model training. 
Moreover, I had some experience in building our own data set for a NLP model.
